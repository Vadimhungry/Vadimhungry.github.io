More than half a year has passed since the last post on this site. Actually, I even forgot about this blog. So it's interesting to compare my previous thoughts with the current ones.

First of all, I still don't have a job. And I still haven't dived deep into the Django framework. But I finished my study projects at Hexlet online school. I also participated in open-source projects like Kosmos CRM and Writing to You.

I've gained some psychological comfort in looking for a job. I'm in the process of finding my field, expertise, and community.

This week, I already had two interviews for the position of Python teacher in an online school for kids. I failed both, but the domain seems really interesting and suitable for me.

As a teacher, you're nurturing the next generation—their knowledge, attitude, and behavior—all at once. And this is so cool because you can experiment, project, and model the future of our society. What could be more inspiring?

I even imagine big plans about it. That is—to acquire some experience in an existing school, develop my Instagram/personal teacher brand, and then grow it into a bigger school based on specific values and approaches. And I already have some friends who could teach kids cool and creative stuff.

So, let's see what happens next!
