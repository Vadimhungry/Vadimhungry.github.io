## Job
Since September, a lot of time has passed. I really started to teach kids programming. Firstly, at Algoritmika school, and later I also got a job at Spring School.

I am totally fascinated because it’s in line with my values, like peacebuilding and creating a better society for the future.

I'm not so content with the salary. It’s not enough to live in Europe, and I still work for Russia, which is a problem. But I am going to fix it. First of all, I’ll improve my English in a few months. Then I'll go to local websites for teachers and schools to try to find a local job in English. It is totally possible. I feel the vibe of the profession and want to continue. So, I should understand the local market and so on, and join the local teachers' community.

To become better at teaching, I’ve already started working on my speech, including pronunciation, voice, and so on.

## Cinema
I keep in touch with Ncineclub. Soon we will announce the next season. It will be a program curated by me. Sounds so serious!

We’ll watch movies about Stalin and his time. So excited! The people in the club are so nice, I want to be friends with them somehow. Or invent friendship, because I’m not so sure what it means today.

## Home
We’ll move to a new flat in Kaimakli next month. Once again – excited!
