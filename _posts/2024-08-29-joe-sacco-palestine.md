A few weeks ago, I finished reading this comic book and wanted to share some thoughts on it.

First of all, I could recommend this book to nearly everyone. It is really good as a book, and the drawings are superb.

The main topic of the book is the life of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank of the Jordan River in the early 90s, after the First Intifada.

Yes, these are just the life stories of quite simple people. But in the context of Israeli and Palestinian politics, this is extremely important because the mainstream Israeli and Western media tend to dehumanize Palestinians completely. That's why we should read Joe Saccoâ€”to return to or start nurturing our humanistic approach towards politics and history.

That is, even if we don't like somebody, we should remember that we don't like a person, a human being. Especially when we're talking about a big group of people.

It is so easy to forget that a collective is not just an amorphous mass of worms but a society composed of individuals with their own free will, interests, and plurality of positions. Joe Sacco managed to show all of this. Not just how hard life is in Gaza, but how Gaza is just an inhabited place.

There are guys supporting Hamas. There are guys who don't like Hamas. Some women like hijabs and Muslim traditions, while others are more feminist. And so on.

Reading this is like having a small talk with a bunch of somewhat typical Palestinians. It is absolutely inspiring because here you get a chance to hear new voices, learn facts, and definitely feel their emotions. Maybe you won't like this nation, maybe you'll argue with their opinions. But you will remember: they are humans just like you and me. And that is a big deal for a comic book.
