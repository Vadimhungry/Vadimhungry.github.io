# It's Me, Eddie by Edward Limonov

Since Friday I'm so ill. Throat was sore, I had a headache, I lied in bed all over Saturday and Sunday. It was horrible. I'd hate to be ill. I feel it like being a swamp. Something is rotten around you. Everything is slow and kinda impossible. Impossible to work, to eat, to move. And I hate it.

Cause today is the time for action and change something in the world or in me or whatever. Display it, share with my friends or enemies. Somebody. To have a clue, to fight for, to feel the resistance of the world. Always wanna play music, never could find where to start. And that it is. Start with your own (my own) responsibility. Bear your own cross, so to say. Don't try to invent, or look for. This is always in vain. That it is—being your own self in exact conditions, in the moment of ever-changing history.

It's hard. A lot of obstacles. A lot of books about it. Guidelines on how to avoid it, not to be the slave of the idols. Big and serious philosophical tradition with Francis Bacon and Emmanuel Kant. The critic of pure reason is almost entirely about how to correctly increase our knowledge. Bacon is the same - he tried to find the way to freedom by avoiding mistakes caused by various biases.he tried to find the way to freedom by avoiding mistakes caused by various biases.    

Much better the Limonov's It's Me, Eddie. Instead of scrupulous analysis of biases and conceptions, the reader gets the dive into raw, unpolished and uncompromised life. Pages pulsating with power and energy. Flow of narrative stops nowhere. It's fluid, it's lively. Narrator has no shame. He speaks directly and radically. Words are bloody, powerful. Judgements are uncompromised, based on personal experience and life, based on love. And this is completely cool.

For me, it's very important to unlock such kind of attitude. To pronounce even stupid ideas. To engage in activities according to my temper. To think in terms of my situation, not in terms of suitable or desirable or normal. That actually means music production. Beating idols with the hammer, enjoying the sound.

Again, Eddie. Main plot is clear. Year 1976, poor Russian intellectual in the USA. Wife abandoned him, but he loves her. And all the book evolves around pure love and delightful, actively investigating life. This and that is of great concern to Eddie. Not only girls and boys. But the destiny of humanity. And cheapest possible food. New York City with all its streets, sluts, students and artists. Russian immigrants, or, more precisely, disgust with Russian immigrants. Cause they dull, boring, the same. The same disgust with American normies—they are the same as in the USSR.

Book is totally recommended for reading. All we need more of this roaring energy, pure love and self-respect. Even if energy and love go against self-respect producing self-humiliation. But it's actually inevitable in life. Better clear, joyful and faithful path of energy. Not the dull intention to calculate everything, make goals for all life, trying to fulfill them even when they are already foreign to us.
