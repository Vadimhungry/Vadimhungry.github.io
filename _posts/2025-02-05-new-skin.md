## Body moves and language
Yesterday I participated in a dance improvisation class by Konstantina Skalionta.

Now we study connections between words and our bodies. This is a practical investigation of how our bodies are moved by words. What moves could be produced by specific words.

It's all about the interrelation of our flesh and the language we use. And even speech.

## New skin
So we were exploring the metaphor of new skin. Starting with direct awareness of the skin that covers our body, we dived deeper into more dance-like or poetic realms.

We were searching for a new skin. Looking for a new form, a new mode of being human, or maybe something completely different. All the while playing with movements of our joints, heads, legs, and sometimes simply staying still.

I came to the realization that most of my movements and postures are habitual. It's a kind of body language—typical, repetitive, always the same. Like common, ready-made, instrumental words. Rather mechanical and routine. They are okay; they fulfill most of my needs somehow. But the skin is old, and here is the chance to look for a new one. Break the habitual. Find a new way—not just to satisfy needs or whatever.

As a result, I started making more jumps. Switching my position from high to low through jumps. Jumping from right to left, changing leg positions through jumps. It worked! At that moment, my dancing became more grounded. I felt as if I had found the ground, Mother Earth, the solid support for my body. And that is the word—'ground'! A bloody word, a word infused with my personal story, reliable and powerful.

## Language as synchronization
As usual, I started my investigation in class by overthinking. It's always a bit hard to dive into the actual flow of creativity. When I hear nearly any guidance on the artistic process, any call to release my imagination, I start pondering it. Like, what does it mean? Was it about this or that? How could I accomplish the task? Such reflections are frustrating and overly individualizing.

So instead of analyzing the content of the speech and tasks, I shifted my attention toward the teacher’s speech—toward her voice. The speed, the tone, the vibe, and the energy produced by it. Because the bodies in the room were very much subjected to and obeyed the voice. Not the content, not the tasks. Even trying to complete the task in this context could mean failure—at least for me. Because to not be totally dissolved in dance, to maintain a distinction between "what I do" and "what I think" is a mistake. Such a mode of being is an old skin, an obstacle to new beauty emerging.

Maybe this breakthrough—through words toward the raw flow of practice, bare synchronization while still maintaining difference—is the revealing of a more fundamental nature of language. Non-algorithmic and organic. When we just infuse existence, experience, and the vibe of our community—like clothes absorb the smell of tobacco when someone is smoking nearby.

Finally, no one can really instruct us. The "one-two-three" approach is just impossible because we still can't understand what 'one' even means. The teacher might feel the same frustration when they find that their clear-cut and detailed instructions bring no results for the student.

And I have always known this. At the age of five, my father said that I should teach my brother to talk. My brother was one year old. Because my father had already taught me how to use language. This was unbearably frustrating. I felt disgusted and protested, but I couldn't express it. I knew that it was simply impossible to teach a newborn. He simply couldn't follow the instructions!
