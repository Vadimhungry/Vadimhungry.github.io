I just finished the book. It was quite intellectually satisfying. However, to be honest, I couldn't fully appreciate all the details because I'm neither a Westerner nor an Arab. I felt a bit detached from the topics and realities of the book.

One of my university teachers recommended "Orientalism" to me in a very special context. At that time, I was interested in reading so-called Eastern texts, primarily Indian and Chinese Buddhist literature. The professor's suggestion was rather awkward. He claimed that the "Eastern" textual tradition is something completely foreign to Westerners. By this, he meant that Russians are also Westerners. Therefore, such texts are meaningless in general, and people from other cultures couldn't truly access them.

This was a consistent position for that teacher. He had, of course, read some "Eastern" texts and comments about them. However, he used references and quotations from that material in an absolutely careless way—as examples of nonsense and unintelligibility, interpreting them as he pleased. His goal was only to express his own thoughts, with no genuine interest in ancient Indian or Chinese culture.

Yet, this same person recommended that I read "Orientalism" by Edward Said! At the time, I thought he was a smart person, but after reading "Orientalism," I realized how incredibly foolish he was! He didn't grasp even a glimpse of Said's ideas, despite how simple they are in intention.

"Orientalism" is, first of all, about a caring and humanistic approach towards cultures and nations. What could be simpler than talking directly with your friend, relative, or neighbor about their own will, desires, and intentions? Nearly nothing. Moreover, care is something fundamental to our lives and interactions. It’s something that we inevitably learn and practice. So why not inquire about a piece of art or culture? About the exact meaning of some ancient or religious text?

Because of Orientalism! That is—because of the simplification of another culture, reducing its complexity to a simplistic template. You only do such a thing in very special cases, usually when you don’t actually want to communicate but instead want to exercise power and subjugate people. And that is not nice at all. Please don’t practice such things! Read Said for a bit more detail.

The most enlightening part of the book for me was the afterword, written by Said in 2003. It’s closer to our times, and the author discusses the reception of the book. "Orientalism" was published in 1978 and has since become very influential in the field of decolonialism and related studies. In the afterword, Said clarifies that the book was intended primarily as a critical study. There are few positive propositions, and the main theses are logically weak. This is super cool because of the total refusal of an essentialist approach.

For example, Said fiercely criticizes false Western interpretations and generalizations of Islam, but he doesn’t defend the religion. Quite the contrary, he says that the growth of Islamic fundamentalism is very problematic, as is simplistic nationalism in some Middle Eastern countries. He also emphasizes that the book is not anti-American or anti-European, only anti-imperialistic. And this is important. Said calls for a human-related, careful, and honest dialogue—not for hatred towards specific people or countries.
