I'm still unemployed, and it's not really good for me—my income or my mental health.

At the beginning of the week, I had an interview for a customer support position at a fintech company. I was interviewed by the current customer support person, who could have become my boss. She was so nice, and I believe we really understood each other. I described my background, and she told me about her work experience. She had also been in a support role for several years. She explained the responsibilities and benefits of the company, and I think she genuinely liked me as a person. But today, she told me that after discussing it with the CEO, they decided to hire someone else—someone who already had years of experience in the fintech sector. Not a surprising decision.

It’s sad, but I’ve got another job lined up. I’ll be a programming teacher at Algorithmika, an online programming school. It’s a part-time job with a fairly low salary, but it’s a cool opportunity, and I’m excited to start. I’ve wanted teaching experience for a long time, and now I finally get to try. I’ve been eager for this, and I see myself as a teacher, even though I lack formal experience.

I’ve thought about teaching for a long time. Whenever I read manuals or instructions, I imagine how to explain the material in a better way. I envision a lesson as a nice, safe space where students can try new things without fear of judgment or criticism. How can a lesson be interesting and inclusive for all students? Everyone is different, with their own unique background. How can they build a community together? I hope to find my own practical answers to these questions.

At the same time, I’m involved in creating a CRM system for an NGO. It’s a bit tiresome, and I’m still confused about using GitHub collectively. I don’t feel competent enough in the Django framework yet, but this is definitely the best project I’ve worked on so far. It aligns so well with my values. I want to provide quality software to NGOs, and I know exactly who will use this software. That’s absolutely awesome.

Right now, though, I sometimes sabotage my own work on the project. I find other, less important but distracting activities. I lose courage when I encounter small bugs, thinking about them for hours. This isn’t good. I know what I need to do: I should discuss everything with my collaborators. They need my expertise and perspective, and they ask for it. They’re nice and supportive. In this case, the money isn’t the main thing—I’m gaining unique experience and making new friends in the field of social work, which is something I’ve wanted for a long time.

In the end, I have a lot of projects to immerse myself in, and I believe it’s important to focus on them as much as possible. At the same time, I’m still looking for a job to pay the bills.
