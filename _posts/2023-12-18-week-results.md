excerpt: This week has been a whirlwind of learning and discovery

This week has been a whirlwind of learning and discovery. Most of my waking hours were dedicated to unraveling the intricacies of Django framework through an online school called Hexlet. As I approach the culmination of the course, the challenge lies in developing a task manager app. I find myself grappling with the framework's abundance of possibilities and pre-made decisions – it's a maze that demands hands-on navigation.

Creating the new user part of authentication became my focus last week. While the journey has been frustrating, the allure of Django's capabilities keeps me going. Learning isn't just about reading through extensive documentation; it's about rolling up your sleeves and implementing features to truly grasp the essence.

During my free hours, Al Sweigart's "Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python" became my companion. The chapter on refactoring from functional to object-oriented programming struck a chord. Now, armed with newfound insights, I have a plan to refactor one of my projects.

Evenings were dedicated to the ancient game of chess. I delved into Ilya Maizelis's "Chess," a timeless guide endorsed by none other than Garry Kasparov himself. The simplicity of the explanations proved to be a game-changer – quite literally. I celebrated my first victory against an experienced chess friend, fueling my appetite to delve deeper.

This week ushered in a new literary companion – "My Favorite Country" by Elena Kostyuchenko. The book serves as a journalistic exploration into contemporary Russia, shedding light on its challenges such as corruption and homophobia. Yet, amidst the turmoil, there's a profound love for the homeland and its people. It's a narrative that navigates the complex tapestry of emotions tied to one's roots.

As I reflect on the past week, it's clear that each struggle and triumph adds a layer to my journey of growth and exploration. Here's to the uncertainties of the upcoming week and the lessons it holds.
