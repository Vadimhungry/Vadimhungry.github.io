This week, I came to the realization that delving into Django can be a challenging and somewhat exhausting endeavor. Despite my best efforts, the theoretical aspects seem intricate, and the framework itself appears vast. Feeling fatigued from the learning process, I've decided to take a short break – a two-week hiatus to recharge.

I've already laid out a plan: I'll be diving into "Django 4 By Example" by Antonio Melé. I hope to find comprehensive materials and clear explanations for working with the framework within its pages. The book covers the creation of various web applications, starting with a blog and concluding with an e-commerce site. I'm confident that after this hands-on practice, I'll emerge as a bona fide junior developer.

Aside from Django, I wrapped up reading "Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart this week. The book proved to be genuinely engaging. Some topics were entirely new to me, such as big-O notation, code formatting using Black, and peculiarities of the Python language. I particularly enjoyed the final chapters on object-oriented programming – in my opinion, the best introduction to Python classes for beginners. The explanations on refactoring from a functional-style program to an object-oriented one were particularly compelling.

A notable achievement this week was enhancing my blog. I added a simple image gallery, bringing me joy and satisfaction. Now, I'm eager to take it a step further, incorporating JavaScript, adding a custom domain, and implementing various other improvements.

Regarding less favorable habits, I found myself consuming alcohol every day this week. While the quantities were modest – two glasses of wine one evening and a can of stout beer another – I can feel their impact. They noticeably reduce my energy levels and concentration. I wasn't as focused as during weeks of complete sobriety. The unequivocal conclusion: alcohol is not the ideal way to unwind midweek.
