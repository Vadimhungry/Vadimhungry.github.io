## About me

I am looking for a junior Python developer position. My main objective is to get my first experience as a developer and improve my skills, so I can work remotely or in the office - any format will be great for me.

Last few years I worked as a technical support engineer. Earn experience in manual testing, troubleshooting, writing SQL queries, and maintaining a consistent knowledge base. Also, I got some experience with programming languages such as PHP and JavaScript. Gradually I came to the conclusion that for me it would be more suitable and interesting to create something by myself and not just fix someone elseâ€™s mistakes. I considered different languages to study and chose Python because of the variety of areas for actual use and the beauty of its syntax.
