# Hello, stranger!

My name is Vadim, and this is my blog.

Corporate social media were never satisfying for me. They are too fast. They are not for conversation or self-presentation. They are like a marketplace—everyone is shouting something, and you can only hear the loudest voices.

But I want to have my own lair, cave, castle, warehouse—whatever.
Uncensored, unpolished. Here, I can archive my life as I wish. Control it. Post slowly, but always with thought and care. Transform the design from time to time as my skills improve or my mind changes.
All this is definitely not about fucking Facebook!

You will find my thoughts on this and that on the [Blog](/blog/) page.
Feel free to explore!
